Who am I?
====
My original background and training was in field biology and bioacoustics where I first began a PhD at Texas A&M University in 2016 to study primate bioacoustics and language evolution. In 2018, I joined [The Music Lab](https://www.themusiclab.org/) under [Samuel Mehr's](https://mehr.cz/) tutelage as a visiting graduate student to work on questions regarding the evolution of infant-directed speech and song. In 2019, I mastered out of my previous PhD program with a thesis on the mimicry of animals by human hunters with [Jeff Winking](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/anthropology/profile/jeffrey-winking/). I then worked for some time in the think tank circuit in Washington, DC. In 2020, I rejoined academia to work on models of innovation and human institutions with [Paul Smaldino](https://smaldino.com/wp/) at the University of California, Merced, where I am today.

What do I study?
====
My research takes a broad approach to study the evolution of humans and the societies we live in. While I started as a primate sensory ecologist, in recent years my research interests have pivoted to the difficult problem of modeling innovation. To this end, I have conducted research in three, broad, disparate regions:

  1. My current research is largely reflected in the fields of cultural evolution and organizational theory where I research innovation from a "collective intelligence" perspective. My main research questions here primarily relate to the structure of organizations and their lifespan where I ask: what are the processes leading to the evolution of organizational structure, how can organizations and groups of agents organize themselves to best leverage information in their environments, and what structures make organizations and institutions vulnerable to collapse? I approach these questions primarily from an agent-based modeling and theoretical standpoint.
  2. A second branch of my research is situated in evolutionary psychology and langauge evolution from a bioacoustic and sensory ecology perspective. Here I have asked questions about the origins of language, proto-language, and music. My approach in this area has mostly involved large-scale corpus research of both acoustic and text-based datasets. 
  3. Finally, I have a broad interest in the broad concept of “modularity” as it pertains to neural networks, collective intelligence, gene regulatory networks, and human mental adaptations. Here I take a largely philosophical approach to the problem, seeking to find generalities between questions of innovation, adaptation, and evolvability in these disparate systems.
