My name is Cody Moser. I am a PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive and Information Sciences](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/) at UC Merced and a Visiting Fellow in the Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

I work on questions related to the evolution of human behavior and human institutions. To do this, I build agent-based models and perform large-scale corpus analysis of text and audio data. You can find more information about me and my research under my [Biography](https://culturologies.co/bio) and can read all of my papers under [Publications and Papers](https://culturologies.co/publications).

Please reach out to me either via [email](mailto:cmoser2@ucmerced.edu) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LTF_01) if you would like to chat.

In the meantime, here's a collaboration network I made of my department. We have 52 nodes, an average clustering coefficient of .16, and a path length of 3.6. In my work on innovation, I have yet to find an organization of this size that is as innovative as ours! You can download the edge list [here](https://culturologies.co/files/Department.csv).
