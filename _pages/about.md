My name is Cody Moser. I am a PhD student in the Department of Cognitive and Information Sciences at UC Merced and an Affiliated Graduate Student in The Music Lab in the School of Psychology at Harvard University. 

I work on questions related to the evolution of human behavior and human institutions. To do this, I build agent-based models and perform large-scale corpus analysis of text and audio data. You can find more information about me and my research under my Biography and can read all of my papers under Publications and Papers.

Please reach out to me either via [email](mailto:cmoser2@ucmerced.edu) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LTF_01) if you would like to chat.

In the meantime, here's a collaboration network I made of [my department](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/). We have 52 nodes, an average clustering coefficient of .16, and a path length of 3.6. In my work on innovation, I have yet to find an organization of this size that is as innovative as ours! You can download the edge list [here](https://culturologies.co/files/Department.csv).
