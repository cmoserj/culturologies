excerpt: 'Theories of innovation often balance the contrasting views that either smart people create smart things or smartly constructed institutions create smart things. Central to models of these views are the roles that that population size, connectivity, and the behavior of individuals themselves play in the discovery of novelty. While population models have shown these factors to be important for innovation, few have taken the individual-central approach seriously by examining the role individuals play within their groups, namely in terms of the inequality of performance between them. To explore how network structures influence not only population-level innovation but also the distribution of performance among individuals, we studied an agent-based model of the Potions Task, a paradigm developed to test how structure affects a group's ability to find novel solutions in a difficult exploration task. We explore how size, connectivity, and the propensity for agents to share information in a network influence innovation and how these have an impact on the emergence of inequality in the network in terms of agent contributions. We find that population size has a negative effect on innovation <i>per capita</i>, that many small groups outperform fewer large groups, that migration has few effects on innovation in the task, and highlight how human social network structures may facilitate role specialization. Moreover, we show that every network factor which improves innovation leads to a proportional increase in inequality of performance in the network, creating "genius effects" among otherwise "dumb" agents in both idealized and real-world networks.'

We suggest that the accounts offered by the target articles could be strengthened by acknowledging the role of group selection and cultural niche construction in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of human music. We argue that group level traits and highly variable cultural niches can explain the diversity of human song, but the target articles' accounts are insufficient to explain such diversity.
